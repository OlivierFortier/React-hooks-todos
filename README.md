#React todos (with hooks !)
A simple todo list to use react using hooks functional components.  
## What did I learn ?
- The fundamentals of react  
- how to set the state with setState() and change it
- destructuring objects and arrays to use with react componenets  
- useEffect() to watch for changes and do something when that thing changes
- passing props in components  
- applying styles -> inline or with styled component
